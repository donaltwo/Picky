Introduction
Title: Picky! 
Picky allows users to click on 5 flavours sweet, sour, bitter, umami, savoury  and 5 textures liquid,crispy,creamy, soft  & hard to help them decide what they want, taking the indecisiveness away around meal time. 

Audience, people with dietary requirements, neurodivergent people or anyone who is picky with what they like to eat.
User Case 1 
A person with dietary requirements, who wants to use Picky! to easily find meals that suit their taste preferences, so that they can confidently choose meals that align with their dietary needs without spending excessive time browsing through menus or recipes.
User Case 2
Neurodivergent people, often struggle with decision-making, especially when it comes to food choices. With Picky!, I hope to simplify the process for them by having them selecting preferred flavors and textures, allowing them make meal decisions more efficiently.
User Case 3
People often find themselves stuck in a cycle of indecision during mealtime. Picky! provides these users with a solution by offering a tailored selection of meals based  alleviating the stress of deciding what to eat next.

Idea: Using JavaScript code a meal picker based on what flavour and texture you want to eat by having an interactable
